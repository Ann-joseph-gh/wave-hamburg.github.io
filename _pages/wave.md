In a first step, the WAVE concept has already been tested under realistic conditions to demonstrate the feasibility and possibilities of such a network on site. To this end, the initiative carried out a proof-of-concept experiment on the DESY/UHH campus in Bahrenfeld in May 2021, using, among other things, a 12.6 km long, existing and continuous strand of currently unused telecommunications fiber as a series of seismic sensors. The wave field was recorded at high resolution, with 1 m intervals along the entire length of the fiber. In the following, we summarize the development of this measurement campaign, and present a selection of initial observations. 

Since then, we have expanded the network to currently 19 km of fiber, organized several [*outreach*]({{ "/outreach" | relative_url }}) and Livestreams of the data, including during a Taylor Swift concert. We hold regular Workshops and other events, and of course we also use the data for a range of interdisciplinary Scientific analysis!

## Map of the DAS-fiber track

In 2021 we started with a 12.6 km fiber test track and performed the proof-of-concept experiment. Now, we established a 19 km fiber paths providing us 19000 distributed seismic sensors on the Campus, reading out with a single DAS interrogator. 
The current fiber track is shown in the following map in yellow and contains
* 2 times 3.4 km EuXFEL tunnel some meters below the surface
* 1 times the PETRA ring, where the fiber goes partly through buildings, in tunnels and on cable trays
* one Campus loop 

In the northeast, the fiber runs through the 'Max von Laue' experimental hall and briefly follows the circular path of PETRA there. Zoom in for more detail.

## Other seismic sensors

In addition to seismic sensors, we also have other seismic sensors on campus from the various institutions whose data we can access. These include broadband seismometers with high sensitivity, even over long measurement periods, and geophones, which are more capable of measuring signals in the high-frequency range.  

## Where is WAVE headed?

Over the next years, we intend to realise a seismic and geo-acoustic measurement network in and around the Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld. WAVE will become a unique and innovative infrastructure for geophysics and physics experiments and a core asset for the Science City and its partners.

One of the long-term goals is studying the optimal placement and characteristics of seismo-acoustic sensors. On the data side of things, we will establish common data transmission and processing pipelines, as well as create data sharing and usage policies. This specifically includes the handling and storing of data according to data protection laws.

Major scientific advances are foreseen in seismology and geophysical modelling, urban systems research, real-time machine learning, and, prominently, low-latency predictions for active disturbance reduction. WAVE will also foster the development and integration of novel sensors, such as quantum-based inertial sensors, to continuously increase its capabilities.

The internationally unique infrastructure and science network will establish best practices for vibration cancellation in large-scale and precision physics experiments, bringing new frontiers of precision measurements into reach, while simultaneously providing insight into the evolution of the Science City at and beneath its surface.
