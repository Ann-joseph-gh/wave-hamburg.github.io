title: About WAVE
---

In a first step, the WAVE concept has already been tested under realistic conditions to demonstrate the feasibility and possibilities of such a network on site. To this end, the initiative carried out a proof-of-concept experiment on the DESY/UHH campus in Bahrenfeld in May 2021, using, among other things, a 12.6 km long, existing and continuous strand of currently unused telecommunications fiber as a series of seismic sensors. The wave field was recorded at high resolution, with 1 m intervals along the entire length of the fiber. In the following, we summarize the development of this measurement campaign, and present a selection of initial observations. Now, we established a 19 km fiber paths providing us 19000 distributed seismic sensors on the Campus.

Map of the fiber test track in the proof of concept experiment at the Bahrenfeld Campus and in the tunnel of EuXFEL (yellow). In the northeast, the fiber runs through the 'Max von Laue' experimental hall and briefly follows the circular path of PETRA there. Other sensors (seismometers and geophones) are also shown on the map as blue triangles. Zoom in for more detail.

## Where is WAVE headed?

Over the next years, we intend to realise a seismic and geo-acoustic measurement network in and around the Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld. WAVE will become a unique and innovative infrastructure for geophysics and physics experiments and a core asset for the Science City and its partners.

One of the long-term goals is studying the optimal placement and characteristics of seismo-acoustic sensors. On the data side of things, we will establish common data transmission and processing pipelines, as well as create data sharing and usage policies. This specifically includes the handling and storing of data according to data protection laws.

Major scientific advances are foreseen in seismology and geophysical modelling, urban systems research, real-time machine learning, and, prominently, low-latency predictions for active disturbance reduction. WAVE will also foster the development and integration of novel sensors, such as quantum-based inertial sensors, to continuously increase its capabilities.

The internationally unique infrastructure and science network will establish best practices for vibration cancellation in large-scale and precision physics experiments, bringing new frontiers of precision measurements into reach, while simultaneously providing insight into the evolution of the Science City at and beneath its surface.
