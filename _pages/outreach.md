## Soccer: Public ``''hearing``'' EM24 

Can we hear the goals from the Euros below ground?

With our WAVE glass fiber, we listen to vibrations underground with a thousand ears. On the 5th of July 2024, when France and Portugal met at the Volksparkstadion Hamburg for the quarter finals, just 2 km from our experiment, we livestreamed our vibration measureements during the match. When goals are scored, the celebrations cause the kind of vibrations that we can measure! We tested how sensitive our setup is and whether we can see the vibrations within the fiber.

What am I looking at??

## WAVE Field and Science City Day

On Saturday, 1st June 2024 from 11:00 - 19:00, the WAVE team was be present at the Science City Day, to show you what the measurements with our fiber-optic seismic network look like. Can you find out where our fiber is buried? Can you generate seismic waves? What if you hop around on a bouncy castle?? Come try it out on the DESY campus!
