## WAVE Field and Science City Day

On Saturday, 1st June 2024 from 11:00 - 19:00, the WAVE team was be present at the Science City Day, to show you what the measurements with our fiber-optic seismic network look like. Can you find out where our fiber is buried? Can you generate seismic waves? What if you hop around on a bouncy castle?? Come try it out on the DESY campus!
